          <h5>This diagram describes the relationship between C++, Python, and Unity in the Fox Engine. For this game, C++ acted as the backend, creating all of the building blocks. The backend handled all of the graphics and physics. Python acted as the frontend, in which the physics and graphics of the C++ code was combined to create scripts for the different assets in the game (i.e. the ball, background, brick, etc.). Finally, Unity acted as the level editor/engine. Through a unity application levels could be set up, including the positioning and health of the breakout bricks.</h5>
